# Email-Spam-Classifier

This repository contains the implementation of a Simple Spam Email Detector. A lot of concepts were inspired from the book: [Machine Learning Techniques for Text, By Nikos Tsourakis](https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-techniques-for-text/9781803242385)

I have implemented simple classfier based out on SVM and Navie Bayes Classifier. SVM was able to achieve a higher accuracy of around 92%. The repository consists of the python notebook, which we go in details about the type of data cleaning and preprocessing techniques used on the data. The notebook also contains the implementation of the models and evaluation of the models under standard metrics.
